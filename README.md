# IMPORTANT
Do not send too many at once, it will freeze your whatsapp and you will not be able to send more messages!

# WhatsappBomber
Will send multiple messages to someone through Whatsapp. Be warned this could lead to you getting blocked or potentially crash or slow down Whatsapp.\
You will need a valid phone number registered to Whatsapp, the Whatsapp app and an active internet connection for this to work. \
I do not take responsibility for any damages caused by this program. Use at your own risk. 

Typically ~100 messages sent at once will not be a problem, but Whatsapp will take some time to send them out. Any number of messages over around 500(?) will cause Whatsapp to run very slow. I am unsure of the exact number as I had to end the program prematurely because of the above reasons. 

Do note that the reciepient's name must be the one stored in your contacts. You can check them in the Whatsapp mobile app. \
This program is written using Python 3.7 with the selenium module. \
Before running the code, make sure you have selenium installed. \

Important: You need to create a file with Chromedriver.exe on your computer. You can go to https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads to get the latest version. You will then need to get the path of the file (Properties or More Info) and paste it into line 9 of the code.\
The code should look like:\
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=r'YOURPATHHERE')\
\
And you would need to change it to:\
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=r' Your Chromedriver.exe path ')
